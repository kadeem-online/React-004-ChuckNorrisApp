# Chuck Norris Jokes

A simple app made in react that fetches data from the
[Chuck Norris Jokes API](https://api.chucknorris.io/). The main goal was learning the
basics of using [Raect Query | Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/) to better
handle asynchronous fetching of data within React. The implementation of it is most likely
not optimal, nevertheless I have appreciated the benefits and ease it provides in managing
async codes without me needing to manage the state and fetch requests manually.
